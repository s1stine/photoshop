# Sakamata Chloe Photoshop Theme
This is a Photoshop "theme" I "worked" on, to ditch out of the ~~"boring"~~ default interface. Hope you enjoy! (I never steal arts, credits given below).  
If the author of the artwork below has any issues with this work, please contact me immediately on email npl@duck.com or Discord s1s#7826.
Thanks!
